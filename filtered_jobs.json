OIS provides the technology systems and services that support more than 11,000 OHA and DHS agency staff at local offices and facilities around the state. These systems and services help the two agencies determine client service program eligibility; provide medical, housing, food and job assistance; provide addiction, mental health, vocational and rehabilitative services; protect children, seniors and people with physical and/or developmental disabilities; process claims and benefits; manage provider licensing and state hospital facilities; and promote and protect the state public health.The Oregon Department of Human Services (ODHS) provides a number of social programs to qualifying Oregon citizens. One of these programs, the Jobs Opportunity and Basic Skills (JOBS), is funded through Temporary Assistance to Needy Families (TANF) and seeks to provide assistance for and remove barriers to economic independence. The JOBS program contracts with private vendors to provide services to Oregonians with the goal of helping them develop necessary skills and receive needed services to become financially and economically self-sufficient. The ODHS is committed to continuous improvement by measuring the performance of different program elements. Evaluating the success of the JOBS program is done through their Self-Sufficiency Programs (SSP) Employment and Training (E&T) area of ODHS. The SSP selected the Jobs Opportunity and Basic Skills (JOBS) as an area to be measured to determine success and to determine what, if any, program adjustments are needed for the purpose of meeting goals.JOBS offers services to participants, in four service categories which include Stability, Wellbeing, Education and Training, and Job Readiness/Employment. A workgroup was created to define success for each contracted service. The evaluation program has had input from E&T Policy, local SSP staff, the Office of Reporting, Research, Analytics, and Implementation (ORRAI), and JOBS contractors.OIS seeks an experienced Software Engineer IV to provide programming and application development support to the JOBS Outcome Indicators (JOI) application, a web-based system which has been developed to collect and manage data from contract vendors related to services provided to program participants.

OIS provides the technology systems and services that support more than 11,000 OHA and DHS agency staff at local offices and facilities around the state. These systems and services help the two agencies determine client service program eligibility; provide medical, housing, food and job assistance; provide addiction, mental health, vocational and rehabilitative services; protect children, seniors and people with physical and/or developmental disabilities; process claims and benefits; manage provider licensing and state hospital facilities; and promote and protect the state public health.The Oregon Department of Human Services (ODHS) provides a number of social programs to qualifying Oregon citizens. One of these programs, the Jobs Opportunity and Basic Skills (JOBS), is funded through Temporary Assistance to Needy Families (TANF) and seeks to provide assistance for and remove barriers to economic independence. The JOBS program contracts with private vendors to provide services to Oregonians with the goal of helping them develop necessary skills and receive needed services to become financially and economically self-sufficient. The ODHS is committed to continuous improvement by measuring the performance of different program elements. Evaluating the success of the JOBS program is done through their Self-Sufficiency Programs (SSP) Employment and Training (E&T) area of ODHS. The SSP selected the Jobs Opportunity and Basic Skills (JOBS) as an area to be measured to determine success and to determine what, if any, program adjustments are needed for the purpose of meeting goals.JOBS offers services to participants, in four service categories which include Stability, Wellbeing, Education and Training, and Job Readiness/Employment. A workgroup was created to define success for each contracted service. The evaluation program has had input from E&T Policy, local SSP staff, the Office of Reporting, Research, Analytics, and Implementation (ORRAI), and JOBS contractors.OIS seeks an experienced Software Engineer IV to provide programming and application development support to the JOBS Outcome Indicators (JOI) application, a web-based system which has been developed to collect and manage data from contract vendors related to services provided to program participants.

These systems and services help the two agencies determine client service program eligibility; provide medical, housing, food and job assistance; provide addiction, mental health, vocational and rehabilitative services; protect children, seniors and people with physical and/or developmental disabilities; process claims and benefits; manage provider licensing and state hospital facilities; and promote and protect the state public health.The Oregon Department of Human Services (ODHS) provides a number of social programs to qualifying Oregon citizens. One of these programs, the Jobs Opportunity and Basic Skills (JOBS), is funded through Temporary Assistance to Needy Families (TANF) and seeks to provide assistance for and remove barriers to economic independence. The JOBS program contracts with private vendors to provide services to Oregonians with the goal of helping them develop necessary skills and receive needed services to become financially and economically self-sufficient. The ODHS is committed to continuous improvement by measuring the performance of different program elements. Evaluating the success of the JOBS program is done through their Self-Sufficiency Programs (SSP) Employment and Training (E&T) area of ODHS. The SSP selected the Jobs Opportunity and Basic Skills (JOBS) as an area to be measured to determine success and to determine what, if any, program adjustments are needed for the purpose of meeting goals.JOBS offers services to participants, in four service categories which include Stability, Wellbeing, Education and Training, and Job Readiness/Employment. A workgroup was created to define success for each contracted service. The evaluation program has had input from E&T Policy, local SSP staff, the Office of Reporting, Research, Analytics, and Implementation (ORRAI), and JOBS contractors.OIS seeks an experienced Software Engineer IV to provide programming and application development support to the JOBS Outcome Indicators (JOI) application, a web-based system which has been developed to collect and manage data from contract vendors related to services provided to program participants.

One of these programs, the Jobs Opportunity and Basic Skills (JOBS), is funded through Temporary Assistance to Needy Families (TANF) and seeks to provide assistance for and remove barriers to economic independence. The JOBS program contracts with private vendors to provide services to Oregonians with the goal of helping them develop necessary skills and receive needed services to become financially and economically self-sufficient. The ODHS is committed to continuous improvement by measuring the performance of different program elements. Evaluating the success of the JOBS program is done through their Self-Sufficiency Programs (SSP) Employment and Training (E&T) area of ODHS. The SSP selected the Jobs Opportunity and Basic Skills (JOBS) as an area to be measured to determine success and to determine what, if any, program adjustments are needed for the purpose of meeting goals.JOBS offers services to participants, in four service categories which include Stability, Wellbeing, Education and Training, and Job Readiness/Employment.

These systems and services help the two agencies determine client service program eligibility; provide medical, housing, food and job assistance; provide addiction, mental health, vocational and rehabilitative services; protect children, seniors and people with physical and/or developmental disabilities; process claims and benefits; manage provider licensing and state hospital facilities; and promote and protect the state public health.The Oregon Department of Human Services (ODHS) provides a number of social programs to qualifying Oregon citizens. One of these programs, the Jobs Opportunity and Basic Skills (JOBS), is funded through Temporary Assistance to Needy Families (TANF) and seeks to provide assistance for and remove barriers to economic independence. The JOBS program contracts with private vendors to provide services to Oregonians with the goal of helping them develop necessary skills and receive needed services to become financially and economically self-sufficient. The ODHS is committed to continuous improvement by measuring the performance of different program elements. Evaluating the success of the JOBS program is done through their Self-Sufficiency Programs (SSP) Employment and Training (E&T) area of ODHS. The SSP selected the Jobs Opportunity and Basic Skills (JOBS) as an area to be measured to determine success and to determine what, if any, program adjustments are needed for the purpose of meeting goals.JOBS offers services to participants, in four service categories which include Stability, Wellbeing, Education and Training, and Job Readiness/Employment. A workgroup was created to define success for each contracted service. The evaluation program has had input from E&T Policy, local SSP staff, the Office of Reporting, Research, Analytics, and Implementation (ORRAI), and JOBS contractors.OIS seeks an experienced Software Engineer IV to provide programming and application development support to the JOBS Outcome Indicators (JOI) application, a web-based system which has been developed to collect and manage data from contract vendors related to services provided to program participants.
